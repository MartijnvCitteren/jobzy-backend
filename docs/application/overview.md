# Application overview

How the jobzy-backend works today. Start here before changing code; read the aggregate page for the area you touch.
This describes what is on `main` — plans and roadmap live in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, decisions in `docs/adr/`.

## Modules

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `jobzy-contracts` | OpenAPI spec(s), the source of truth for the HTTP API. Consumed by the frontend team. |
| `jobzy-api` | The Spring Boot application. Generates the API interfaces and models from the contract at build time, one interface per OpenAPI tag (`VacancyApi`, `GenerationApi`). |

Aggregates and their pages: `vacancy.md` (the vacancy and its manual description) and `generation.md` (AI-drafted
vacancy descriptions).

## Request flow

A request passes through the hexagon in one direction; each arrow is an explicit mapping, no type crosses a layer it
does not belong to.

```
HTTP ─▶ Controller (implements generated *Api interface)
          │  1. bean validation on the generated contract model (@Valid from the spec)
          │  2. adapter-level content validation (e.g. no raw HTML)
          │  3. request mapper: contract model ─▶ command (application/port/in/command)
          ▼
        Use case (application/service, implements a port/in interface)
          │  loads/creates the domain object, calls domain behaviour, saves via a port/out interface
          ▼
        Repository adapter (adapter/out/persistence, implements port/out)
          │  JPA mapper: domain ─▶ JPA entity, Spring Data repository
          ▼
        SQL Server (H2 in tests)
```

The response goes back up the same way: domain object ─▶ response mapper ─▶ generated contract model.

## Layers and what lives where

- **Domain** (`app.jobzy.api.domain`): plain Java, no framework or JSpecify. Aggregates guard their own invariants
  with `Objects.requireNonNull` in builders and checks in value-object constructors. Timestamps are passed in; the
  domain never reads a clock. IDs are UUIDv7 (`UuidV7Generator`), time-ordered so they index well.
- **Application** (`app.jobzy.api.application`): one service per use case, `@NullMarked`. Inbound ports are use-case
  interfaces with command records; outbound ports are repository interfaces. `@Transactional` is only allowed here.
- **Inbound REST adapter** (`adapter.in.rest`): controllers implement the generated `*Api` interfaces. MapStruct
  mappers per direction (`mapper/request`, `mapper/response`).
- **Inbound scheduling adapter** (`adapter.in.scheduling`): `@Scheduled` jobs that only trigger a use case.
- **Outbound AI adapter** (`adapter.out.ai`): LLM providers behind an application port; Spring AI is only used here.
- **Outbound persistence adapter** (`adapter.out.persistence`): JPA entities separate from domain objects, MapStruct
  mappers in between. `BaseJpaEntity` carries the audit columns, filled by Spring Data JPA auditing.
- **Shared** (`app.jobzy.api.shared`): config (`Clock`, CORS, async, scheduling), `BaseException`, the GDPR
  annotations, `Constants` and `TextContentRules` (the no-markup, no-control-character rules for vacancy text, shared by
  request validators and the check on AI drafts).

## Cross-cutting behaviour

- **Errors** are RFC 9457 Problem Details (`application/problem+json`), shape defined in the contract. Per-aggregate
  `@RestControllerAdvice` classes run at highest precedence; `GlobalExceptionHandler` (lowest precedence) handles
  bean-validation failures and is the catch-all for anything else as a 500 without internal details. Validation
  errors name the field but never echo the rejected value, so personal data does not end up in responses or logs.
- **GDPR**: every persisted field is marked `@PersonalData` or `@ProcessData` (enforced by `ArchitectureTest`), so
  anonymization can wipe personal data and keep process data.
- **Time**: a `Clock` bean (`ClockConfig`, Europe/Amsterdam) is injected wherever "now" is needed.
- **Asynchronous work**: `@Async` (enabled in `AsyncConfig`) runs on Spring Boot's application task executor, which
  uses virtual threads (`spring.threads.virtual.enabled`, which also puts Tomcat on virtual threads). Background work is
  started from `@TransactionalEventListener(AFTER_COMMIT)` listeners, so it only starts once the data it needs is
  committed; see `generation.md`. Integration tests swap in a synchronous executor.
- **Scheduled jobs**: enabled in `SchedulingConfig` unless `jobzy.scheduling.enabled=false` (the test profile). Every
  instance runs every job, so jobs must be idempotent. The only job is the generation retention clean-up.
- **Outbound HTTP**: `spring.http.clients.*` sets a 5 s connect and 15 s read timeout on the JDK HTTP client for every
  `RestClient` built from Spring Boot's builder. The Mistral adapter is the only user so far; give a new integration
  its own settings if these do not fit.
- **AI**: Mistral through Spring AI, chat model only (embedding, moderation and OCR auto-configuration are switched off
  with `spring.ai.model.*: none`). Retries are configured explicitly (`spring.ai.retry.*`, 3 attempts); the Spring AI
  default retries for minutes. Calls to the provider are a recurring cost per generation.
- **CORS**: allowed origins come from `jobzy.cors.allowed-origins` (`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`); empty means no CORS
  mapping at all.
- **Security**: the contract declares bearer auth, but there is no authentication or authorization yet. Every endpoint
  is open.

## Configuration and running locally

- Context path `/api/v1`, port 8090.
- Environment: `MISTRAL_API_KEY` is required; the application does not start without it. It is the only AI secret.
- `jobzy.generation.retention` (default `PT32H`) and `jobzy.generation.purge-interval` (default `PT1H`) control the
  generation clean-up.
- Profiles: `local` (SQL Server from `docker-compose.yaml`, CORS for the Vite dev server on `localhost:5173`), `dev`
  (datasource from `SPRING_DATASOURCE_*` environment variables), `test` (in-memory H2).
- **Schema management is `ddl-auto: update`**: Hibernate changes the schema from the entities on startup. There are no
  migrations. Any entity change is therefore a schema change and is flagged by `guardrail-diff` (`schema-change`).
  `update` never alters existing columns: a new `NOT NULL` column on a table with rows (such as `vacancy.language`) or a
  changed column length needs a database reset locally.

## Known gaps

Open issues an agent should know about before building on top of them. Remove an entry in the PR that fixes it.

- Javadoc and code comments refer to ADR 0004 and ADR 0005, which are not in `docs/adr/`.
- `application-local.yml` connects to database `jobzy`, while `docker-compose.yaml` creates `jobzy_db`.
- `BaseJpaEntity.modifiedBy` is never filled: there is no `AuditorAware` yet (no users yet).
